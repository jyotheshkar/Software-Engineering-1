Development of Novah

Background

Novah is a software designed to empower individuals with disabilities by providing seamless computer access using voice commands and natural language processing. The tool aims to break down barriers for those with mobility impairments, allowing them to open applications, access files, access weather and time information, and much moreâ€”all hands-free.

The team of five lacked prior Agile experience and followed a Kanban methodology over five weeks. This approach ensured a continuous flow of tasks, reducing idle time and focusing on moving work from "To Do" to "Done" as quickly as possible.

Requirements:

Using the MoSCoW prioritisation:

- Must-Have:

- Voice navigation and desktop automation

- Natural language processing for communication

- Should-Have:

- Weather and time API integration

- Multifactor authentication (face recognition)

- Could-Have:

- YouTube Integration

- Fun elements (e.g., jokes)

- Won't-Have:

- Advanced data analysis

Method

In the Kanban process, tasks were organized into these columns:

-Backlog: Tasks not yet started

-In Progress: Tasks actively being worked on

-Review: Tasks ready for review and quality checks

-Done: Completed tasks

Each team member picked up tasks from the backlog based on their availability and skillset. Daily stand-ups kept everyone aligned on progress and priority.

The following tasks were managed through Kanban columns over five weeks:

To Do

- Voice navigation and desktop automation

- NLP for natural communication

- Multifactor authentication (face)

- Weather and time APIs

- Website development

In Progress

- NLP refinement

- Gemini 1.5 Pro chatbot integration

- Face authentication development

Done

- Authentication module (hand and face)

- Desktop application access via Python

- Enhanced NLP

- Weather and time API integration

- Jokes and notes modules

- YouTube Integration

- Web scraping for data accessibility

Implementation

The implementation involved moving tasks systematically through the Kanban columns:

1. Backlog Refinement: Key requirements were broken into smaller tasks, placed in the backlog, and prioritised.

2. Daily Stand-ups: Held to keep the team aligned and to adjust task priorities.

3. Task Assignment: Team members chose tasks from the backlog based on their availability and expertise.

4. Continuous Development: Tasks moved through "In Progress" to "Review" and finally "Done," ensuring continuous delivery.

Milestones

The following milestones were reached as tasks moved to "Done":

- Voice Navigation and Desktop Automation: Users could open and navigate applications via voice commands.

- Natural Language Processing: Provided seamless communication using natural language commands.

- Multifactor Authentication: Integrated both hand and face recognition for secure access.

- Weather and Time API Integration: Enabled voice-activated weather and time data retrieval.

- Jokes and Notes: Implemented fun features and note management.

- YouTube Integration: Allowed voice navigation for YouTube searches.

- Web Scraping: Enhanced data accessibility and search functionality.

These milestones reflect how Kanban enabled iterative feature delivery while ensuring a continuous flow.

Gathering Results

A post-development review helped determine whether Novah met the project's requirements:

1. Requirements Fulfilment: All "Must-Have" and "Should-Have" features were completed successfully.

2. Team Collaboration: The Kanban process improved collaboration through transparent task management and regular stand-ups.

3. Future Plans: Additional features could be planned and implemented with ease due to the clear task workflow.
