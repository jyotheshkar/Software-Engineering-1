# Development of Novah Using Kanban

## Background

Novah is a software designed to empower individuals with disabilities by providing seamless computer access using voice commands and natural language processing. The tool aims to break down barriers for those with mobility impairments, allowing them to open applications, access files, check weather and time information, and much moreâ€”all hands-free.

The team of five members followed a Kanban methodology over five weeks due to their lack of prior Agile experience. This approach ensured a continuous flow of tasks, minimized idle time, and maintained consistent progress by focusing on moving work from "To Do" to "Done" quickly and efficiently.

## Requirements

Using the MoSCoW prioritization method, the requirements for Novah were organized as follows:

- **Must-Have**:
  - Voice navigation and desktop automation: Seamless voice command navigation across applications.
  - Natural language processing for communication: Chatbot capable of natural voice interaction.

- **Should-Have**:
  - Weather and time API integration: Voice-enabled weather and time reporting.
  - Multifactor authentication (face recognition): Secure access with face recognition.

- **Could-Have**:
  - YouTube Integration: Voice control for YouTube search and playback.
  - Fun elements (e.g., jokes): Enhance user experience with light-hearted content.

- **Won't-Have**:
  - Advanced data analysis: Complex data analysis won't be included in this iteration.

## Method

In the Kanban process, tasks were organized into these columns:

- **Backlog**: Tasks not yet started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on.
- **Review**: Tasks ready for review and quality checks.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

Each team member chose tasks from the backlog based on availability and skillset, and daily stand-ups kept everyone aligned on progress and priorities.

### Kanban Workflow Breakdown

- **Backlog Refinement**: Key requirements were broken into manageable tasks, prioritized, and placed in the backlog.
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Daily stand-ups were held to synchronize progress and adjust task priorities.
- **Task Assignment**: Team members selected tasks from the backlog according to their expertise.
- **Continuous Development**: Tasks moved consistently through "In Progress" to "Review" and finally "Done," ensuring steady feature delivery.

### Task Progress over Five Weeks

- **To Do**:
  - Voice navigation and desktop automation.
  - NLP for natural communication.
  - Multifactor authentication (face).
  - Weather and time APIs.
  - Website development.

- **In Progress**:
  - NLP refinement.
  - Gemini 1.5 Pro chatbot integration.
  - Face authentication development.

- **Done**:
  - Authentication module (hand and face).
  - Desktop application access via Python.
  - Enhanced NLP.
  - Weather and time API integration.
  - Jokes and notes modules.
  - YouTube integration.
  - Web scraping for data accessibility.

## Milestones

The following milestones were reached as tasks moved through the Kanban workflow:

- **Voice Navigation and Desktop Automation**: Users could open and navigate applications via voice commands.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Provided seamless communication through natural language commands.
- **Multifactor Authentication**: Integrated both hand and face recognition for secure access.
- **Weather and Time API Integration**: Enabled voice-activated weather and time data retrieval.
- **Jokes and Notes**: Implemented fun features and note management.
- **YouTube Integration**: Allowed voice navigation for YouTube searches.
- **Web Scraping**: Enhanced data accessibility and improved search functionality.

## Gathering Results

### Post-Development Review

After development concluded, a comprehensive review evaluated whether Novah met the project's requirements:

1. **Requirements Fulfillment**: All "Must-Have" and "Should-Have" features were successfully implemented and tested.
2. **Team Collaboration**: The Kanban process improved team collaboration through clear task management and consistent daily stand-ups.
3. **Future Plans**: The Kanban methodology provided a clear workflow, which will allow additional features to be planned and implemented smoothly.
